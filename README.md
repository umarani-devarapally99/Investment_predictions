# Investment_predictions


## Project Overview
The Investment Predictions project uses machine learning techniques to predict stock market changes. The goal is to identify market changes earlier than possible with traditional investment models and automate the investment predictions process.

## Problem Statement
The stock market is highly volatile, with frequent and rapid changes. By leveraging machine learning models, we can predict these changes and provide more accurate and timely investment advice.

## Technologies Used
- Machine Learning
- Cassandra Database
- Python
- Cloud Platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- APIs for data scraping

## Dataset
- **Source**: Data scraped from trusted financial websites.
- **Storage**: The dataset is stored in a Cassandra database.
- **Details**: [Astra by DataStax](https://astra.dev/ineuron)

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Cassandra database setup
- Cloud platform account (AWS/GCP/Azure)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/investment-predictions.git
    cd investment-predictions
    ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure the Cassandra database connection**:
    - Update the `config.py` file with your Cassandra connection details.

### Data Scraping
- **Script**: `scrape_data.py`
- **Usage**: 
    ```bash
    python scrape_data.py
    ```

### Data Preprocessing
- **Script**: `preprocess_data.py`
- **Usage**:
    ```bash
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```

### Model Training
- **Script**: `train_model.py`
- **Usage**:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

### API/User Interface
- **API Documentation**: Refer to `api_documentation.md` for API details.
- **User Interface**: `ui.py` (if applicable)

### Deployment
- **Deployment Script**: `deploy.py`
- **Cloud Platform**: [chosen cloud platform]

### Logging
- Logging is implemented using Python's logging library.
- Logs are stored in `logs/` directory.
